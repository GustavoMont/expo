title: Creating a native module
---

import { CodeBlocksTable } from '~/components/plugins/CodeBlocksTable';
import { PlatformTag } from '~/ui/components/Tag';
import { APIBox } from '~/components/plugins/APIBox';


In this tutorial we are going to build a module that reads information about the device and application from native and exposes it to JavaScript.

- application id and bundle identifier
- native version and build version
- any other ideas?
